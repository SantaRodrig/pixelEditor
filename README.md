# Pixel-Editor

This project was to make a pixel editor and build a user interface with different features. The project is to simulate a type of paint application in which the user would be able to customize how big the picture will be from the prompt at the beginning. The user then uses sliders of different colors to select different color intensities. As the user moves the sliders, there is box that would show the current color they would be using. 

Once they have the color ready they can press a pixel on the board. Once the user presses one of the pixels, that color would be saved in queue of last used colors saving up to five, so the user can use a recent color. 

Another feature was the advanced checkbox. This checkbox once clicked on would show that it was checked. While it shows that it is checked, once the user selects a pixel on the board a pop up will show. The pop up will provide two options, one to save the picture allow the user to edit how many pixels they can edit at a time and the other to open an previously made picture. If they selected a previously used picture then from the pixel they originally selected, all the pixels from that point would be edited to load the old picture.

Lastly, once the user is finished drawing their picture, they have the ability to save it an a location they want with the save button.
